Plan:
1. Admit the patient for further workup and management of her pulmonary symptoms and liver complications.
2. Initiate diuretics for management of ascites.
3. Consult pulmonology and oncology for evaluation of the lung tumour.
4. Monitor liver function closely and consider liver transplant evaluation if indicated.
